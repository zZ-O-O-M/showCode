# Example of my code

ToolBox is a box with mechanisms that allow you to work with the agriculture project.
The agriculture project is a system that I am creating with my small team.

This project was started by another programmer, so I'm working with Laravel 5.8 and PHP 7.3

ToolBox is my feature, which I created time ago to simplify the work with some difficult logic.

In addition, I have created an API for this project. Now there are more than 40 methods in it. 
I have added one section of this API to this repository.

The project is under active development. Some points need to be improved, and I'm working on it
